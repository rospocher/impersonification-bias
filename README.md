# Census-like survey responses generated by LLM-impersonated profiles

The [dataset](./data) comprises 6,400 census-like surveys generated by four widely used large language models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google Gemma 3 27B, and AllenAI OLMo 2 32B). Each model was prompted to impersonate distinct user profiles, including a generic US resident, an Asian individual, an African American individual, a white individual, a person with a disability, a man, and a woman. The repository further provides the [code](./code) employed to generate these profiles and the [results](./results) of statistical analyses comparing the collected data across models, demographic profiles, and with real-world benchmarks.
